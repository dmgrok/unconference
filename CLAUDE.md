## Architecture Overview

### Framework & Stack
- **Nuxt 3** application with Vue 3 and TypeScript
- **Vuetify** UI framework with Material Design Icons
- **Winston** logging system
- **Zod** schema validation
- **nuxt-auth-utils** for authentication (GitHub OAuth support)

### Core Data Models
- **DiscussionTopic** (`types/topic.ts`): Topics with voting system, badges, round selection, and round tracking
- **User** (`types/user.ts`): Users with Admin/User roles
- **RoundHistory** (`types/topic.ts`): Historical round data with selected topics and participants
- **ActiveRound** (`types/topic.ts`): Current round state with timer and topic selection
- **TopicSelection** (`types/topic.ts`): Topic selection interface for round management

### Application Structure
- **Pages**: Dashboard, settings, admin interfaces with automatic authentication middleware
- **Authentication**: Multi-provider OAuth integration (Google, GitHub) with role-based access (SuperAdmin/Admin/User)
- **Middleware**: Automatic authentication enforcement for non-public pages
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with SQLite/PostgreSQL support (file-based JSON storage deprecated)

### Environment Configuration
Critical environment variables:
- `NUXT_TOPICS_FILE_PATH` / `NUXT_USERS_FILE_PATH` - Data file locations
- `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` / `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` - GitHub OAuth configuration
- `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` - Google OAuth configuration
- `NUXT_MAX_VOTES_PER_TOPIC` - Voting limits (default: 12)
- `APP_ENV` - Controls dev mode and logging levels

### Key Features
- **Voting System**: Topics can accumulate votes and badges with preference-based weighted voting
- **Round Management**: Advanced round system with topic selection, timers, and participant redistribution
- **Round Selection**: Topics can be selected/frozen for discussion rounds with manual admin control
- **Timer System**: Configurable round timers with real-time countdown and auto-expiration
- **Participant Assignment**: Automatic assignment of users to topics based on voting preferences
- **Round History**: Complete tracking of past rounds with detailed analytics
- **Auto-save**: Visual feedback system for settings changes
- **Admin Functions**: Special pages and functionality for admin users including round management
- **Logging**: Winston-based logging with file output in production

### File Organization
- `server/api/` - API routes for topics, authentication, voting, and round management
- `server/api/admin/` - Admin-specific API routes including round management
- `components/` - Vue components (AppTitle, LoginForm, UnconferenceHeader)
- `composables/` - Vue composables (useAppTheme, useEventConfig, useAdminSettings)
- `pages/admin/` - Admin-only pages including round management interface
- `types/` - TypeScript type definitions including round management types
- `utils/` - Utility functions (logger)
- `data/` - JSON data files including round history and active round state
- `docs/` - Documentation including round management guide

### Docker Support
- Dockerfile configured for containerized deployment
- Volume mounting for data persistence
- Environment file support for configuration

## Project Structure & Navigation

### Documentation Organization
- `docs/business/` - Business strategy, pricing, and market analysis

- `docs/security/` - Security configuration and monitoring
- `docs/improvements/` - Development improvements and updates
- `docs/reviews/` - Experience reviews and assessments
- `docs/archive/` - Historical documentation and implementation logs

### API Endpoint Structure
- `/api/topics` - Topic CRUD operations and voting
- `/api/auth/` - Authentication handlers (Google, GitHub)
- `/api/admin/` - Admin-only functionality (round management, user administration)
- `/api/rounds/` - Round management and timer operations
- `/api/users/` - User profile and preference management

### Database Schema (Prisma)
- **Event** - Main event entity with settings and configuration
- **Topic** - Discussion topics with voting and round assignment
- **User** - User profiles with roles and OAuth integration
- **Vote** - Voting relationships between users and topics
- **Round** - Round management with timer and participant tracking
- **RoomAssignment** - Topic-to-room mapping for events

## Development Workflow

### Common Development Tasks
1. **Adding Features**: Follow feature specification in `docs/features/`
2. **API Changes**: Update both implementation and `docs/api-documentation.md`
3. **Database Changes**: Create Prisma migrations and update schema docs
4. **Security Updates**: Document changes in `docs/security/`
5. **Testing**: Update test cases in `docs/testing/` and implement automated tests

### Code Quality Guidelines
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Vue 3 Composition API patterns
- Implement proper error handling with Winston logging
- Use Zod for API validation
- Follow conventional commit format for changelog automation

### Troubleshooting Common Issues
- **OAuth Setup**: Check `docs/guides/oauth-setup.md` for provider configuration
- **Database Issues**: Verify Prisma connection and migration status
- **Environment**: Ensure all required environment variables are set
- **Build Errors**: Check Node.js version (18+) and npm dependencies

## Task Master Integration
Task Master commands are available through the `.claude/` directory structure. Use specialized agents and commands for complex development workflows.
