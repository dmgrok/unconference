# Implementation Plan: Plan Command Implementation

**Branch**: `001-plan-implementation` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-plan-implementation/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Implementation of a structured /plan command system for the unconference management application to support systematic feature development, constitutional compliance validation, and automated artifact generation following established development principles.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript with Node.js 18+, Vue 3, Nuxt 3.17.3
**Primary Dependencies**: Nuxt 3, Vue 3, Vuetify, Prisma ORM, nuxt-auth-utils, Winston, Zod
**Storage**: SQLite database via Prisma ORM with file-based data support
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Playwright (e2e), @vue/test-utils
**Target Platform**: Web application (SSR/SPA), Docker containerized deployment
**Project Type**: web - frontend + backend in single Nuxt application
**Performance Goals**: <500ms page loads, real-time voting updates, efficient database queries
**Constraints**: Constitutional compliance required, existing user base maintenance, backwards compatibility
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant event management, 50+ concurrent users per event, complex permission system

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**Initial Assessment**: PASS - No constitutional violations detected

### Constitutional Principles Applied:
1. **Library-First Approach**: Plan command functionality will be implemented as modular, reusable components
2. **CLI Interface Compatibility**: Integration with existing command structure and script-based workflows
3. **Test-First Development**: All new functionality will have tests written before implementation
4. **Integration Testing**: Focus on testing plan generation, artifact creation, and constitutional validation
5. **Observability**: Structured logging for plan execution and error tracking

### Complexity Assessment:
- No new external dependencies beyond existing stack
- No new database schema changes required
- Implementation fits within existing Nuxt 3 architecture
- No violations of YAGNI principles - all components serve clear purposes

**Status**: ✅ PASS - Ready to proceed to Phase 0

```

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Existing Nuxt 3 application with unified frontend/backend structure

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
Based on the generated design artifacts, the /tasks command will create a comprehensive implementation plan with the following approach:

1. **Foundation Tasks** (from data-model.md):
   - Create TypeScript interfaces for all entities (PlanTemplate, PlanExecution, etc.)
   - Implement Zod validation schemas for runtime type checking
   - Set up database models/storage layer (if persistence needed)
   - Create utility functions for entity manipulation

2. **API Implementation Tasks** (from contracts/plan-api.yaml):
   - Create Nuxt API route handlers for each endpoint
   - Implement request/response validation using Zod
   - Add authentication middleware integration
   - Create error handling and logging utilities

3. **Core Logic Tasks** (from research.md decisions):
   - Implement PlanExecutor class with phase management
   - Create ConstitutionalValidator with rule engine
   - Build template processing system
   - Add artifact generation functionality

4. **Integration Tasks** (from quickstart.md requirements):
   - Create CLI wrapper scripts for API endpoints
   - Integrate with existing npm script patterns
   - Add git hook integration points
   - Implement configuration management

**Ordering Strategy**:
- **Phase A** (Foundation): Types → Validation → Storage [P]
- **Phase B** (Core Logic): Executor → Validator → Templates [Sequential]
- **Phase C** (API Layer): Routes → Middleware → Error Handling [P]
- **Phase D** (Integration): CLI → Hooks → Config [Sequential]
- **Phase E** (Testing): Unit → Integration → Contract Tests [P]

**Test Strategy Integration**:
- Each entity creation task paired with corresponding test task
- Contract tests for each API endpoint before implementation
- Integration tests for complete plan execution workflows
- Performance tests for plan generation under load

**Parallel Execution Opportunities**:
- Type definitions and validation schemas [P]
- Independent API route implementations [P]
- Separate utility function implementations [P]
- Individual test file creation [P]

**Dependencies and Constraints**:
- Constitutional validator must be implemented before full execution
- Template system required before artifact generation
- API authentication integration depends on existing auth system
- File system operations require proper permission handling

**Estimated Task Breakdown**:
- Foundation: 8-10 tasks (types, validation, storage setup)
- Core Logic: 12-15 tasks (execution engine, validation, templates)
- API Layer: 8-10 tasks (endpoints, middleware, error handling)
- Integration: 6-8 tasks (CLI, hooks, configuration)
- Testing: 15-20 tasks (unit, integration, contract tests)
- **Total**: 49-63 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**Quality Gates**:
- All tests must be written before implementation (TDD)
- Constitutional compliance validation at each phase
- Code review checkpoints after each major component
- Integration testing before final delivery

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
