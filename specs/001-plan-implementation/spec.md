# Feature Specification: Plan Command Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of the /plan command functionality within the existing unconference management system to support structured feature development and planning workflows.

## Business Requirements

### Primary Requirement
Integrate a plan command system that can analyze project requirements, break down complex features into manageable phases, and generate structured implementation plans following constitutional principles.

### User Stories

**As a developer**, I want to use a `/plan` command so that I can:
- Analyze feature requirements systematically
- Generate structured implementation plans
- Follow constitutional development principles
- Break complex features into manageable phases
- Track progress through standardized workflows

**As a project maintainer**, I want the plan system to:
- Ensure consistent development practices
- Maintain project quality standards
- Generate appropriate documentation artifacts
- Support test-driven development workflows

## Functional Requirements

### Core Features

1. **Plan Command Integration**
   - Accept feature specifications as input
   - Generate structured implementation plans
   - Follow constitutional principles
   - Create appropriate documentation artifacts

2. **Phase-Based Planning**
   - Phase 0: Research and analysis
   - Phase 1: Design and contracts
   - Phase 2: Task planning approach (describe only)
   - Support for future phases 3-5

3. **Artifact Generation**
   - Research documentation (research.md)
   - Data model specifications (data-model.md)
   - API contracts (contracts/ directory)
   - Quickstart guides (quickstart.md)
   - Task planning documentation

4. **Constitutional Compliance**
   - Validate against constitutional principles
   - Document complexity justifications
   - Ensure test-first development
   - Follow library-first approach

## Technical Requirements

### System Integration
- Integrate with existing Nuxt 3 unconference application
- Support TypeScript development
- Work with existing Prisma database schema
- Maintain compatibility with current testing framework

### Development Standards
- Follow existing project conventions
- Maintain code quality standards
- Support both development and production environments
- Ensure proper error handling and validation

### Documentation Standards
- Generate markdown-based documentation
- Support cross-referencing between artifacts
- Maintain version control integration
- Follow established documentation patterns

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Plan generation should complete within reasonable time
- Artifact creation should be efficient
- Research phase should not exceed practical limits

### Maintainability
- Code should follow existing project patterns
- Documentation should be self-updating
- Plans should be version-controllable
- Integration should be non-disruptive

### Scalability
- Support multiple concurrent planning sessions
- Handle complex feature specifications
- Scale with project growth

## Acceptance Criteria

### Phase 0 Completion
- [ ] Research documentation generated
- [ ] All technical unknowns resolved
- [ ] Constitutional compliance verified
- [ ] Technical context fully populated

### Phase 1 Completion
- [ ] Data model specifications created
- [ ] API contracts generated
- [ ] Contract tests written (failing)
- [ ] Quickstart guide created
- [ ] Agent context files updated

### Phase 2 Completion
- [ ] Task planning approach documented
- [ ] Implementation strategy defined
- [ ] Progress tracking established
- [ ] Complexity tracking completed

### Overall Success Criteria
- [ ] All phases execute without errors
- [ ] Generated artifacts are valid and useful
- [ ] Constitutional principles are followed
- [ ] Documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] System integrates cleanly with existing codebase

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints
- Must work within existing Nuxt 3 architecture
- Cannot modify core unconference functionality
- Must maintain existing database schema compatibility
- Should follow existing TypeScript patterns

### Development Constraints
- Follow test-driven development practices
- Maintain existing code quality standards
- Preserve existing authentication and authorization
- Support existing deployment methods

### Business Constraints
- Implementation should not disrupt current users
- Changes should be backwards compatible
- Documentation must be maintainable
- Solution should be cost-effective
