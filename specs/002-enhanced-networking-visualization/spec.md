# Feature Specification: Enhanced Networking Visualization

**Feature Branch**: `002-enhanced-networking-visualization`
**Created**: 2025-09-16
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Enhanced networking visualization with interactive relationship mapping, connection strength indicators, and collaborative workspace integration for unconference participants"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Networking visualization + interactive mapping + connection indicators + workspace integration
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: unconference participants, facilitators
   ’ Actions: visualize networks, interact with relationships, view connection strength, integrate workspaces
   ’ Data: participant profiles, connections, collaboration spaces, interaction history
   ’ Constraints: real-time updates, intuitive interface, integration requirements
3. Ambiguities marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
4. User scenarios defined for participant networking workflows
5. Functional requirements generated for visualization and interaction capabilities
6. Key entities identified: participants, connections, workspaces, visualizations
7. Review checklist validated
8. SUCCESS: Spec ready for planning
```

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As an unconference participant, I want to visualize my networking connections and relationship strengths so that I can identify collaboration opportunities, understand my network growth, and find relevant people to connect with for ongoing projects and knowledge sharing.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am logged into the unconference platform, **When** I navigate to the networking visualization, **Then** I see an interactive map showing my connections with other participants
2. **Given** I have made multiple connections during the event, **When** I view the visualization, **Then** I can see connection strength indicators that reflect the depth and quality of my interactions
3. **Given** I am exploring potential collaborations, **When** I interact with participant nodes in the visualization, **Then** I can view their profiles, shared interests, and current workspace participation
4. **Given** I want to join a collaborative workspace, **When** I select a workspace from the visualization, **Then** I can see workspace details and request to join or view ongoing activities
5. **Given** I am a facilitator monitoring event networking, **When** I access the visualization dashboard, **Then** I can view aggregated networking metrics and identify participants who may need connection support

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a participant has no connections yet (empty network state)?
- How does the system handle participants who join mid-event or leave early?
- What happens when workspace collaboration data is unavailable or outdated?
- How does the visualization perform with large numbers of participants (100+ people)?
- What happens when connection strength data is incomplete or unreliable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display an interactive network visualization showing participant connections and relationships
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide connection strength indicators that reflect interaction quality and frequency
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to interact with visualization nodes to view participant profiles and connection details
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate with collaborative workspace data to show workspace participation and project connections
- **FR-005**: System MUST update visualization data in real-time as new connections and interactions occur during the event
- **FR-006**: Users MUST be able to filter and search the network visualization by [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: filtering criteria not specified - skills, interests, roles, workspace participation?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: access level not specified - public view vs private networking data, role-based permissions?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST calculate connection strength based on [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: strength calculation method not specified - interaction time, shared activities, mutual connections, user ratings?]
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user actions not specified - initiate new connections, send messages, join workspaces directly from visualization?]
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data privacy requirements not specified - who can see what networking data, opt-out mechanisms?]
- **FR-011**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: visualization modes not specified - different layouts, zoom levels, time-based filtering?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST persist networking visualization preferences and [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: data retention period not specified for interaction history and connection metadata]

### Key Entities
- **Participant**: Event attendee with profile information, networking preferences, and connection history
- **Connection**: Relationship between two participants with strength indicators, interaction metadata, and collaboration context
- **Workspace**: Collaborative environment where participants work together on projects or discussions
- **NetworkVisualization**: Interactive display showing participant relationships, connection patterns, and workspace integrations
- **InteractionEvent**: Record of participant interactions used to calculate connection strengths and update visualizations
- **CollaborationLink**: Association between participants and workspaces showing current and historical collaboration activities
