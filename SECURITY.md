# Security Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented in the unconference application to protect against malicious users and common attack vectors.

## Security Features Implemented

### 1. Rate Limiting
- **General API endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per IP
- **Authentication endpoints**: 10 requests per minute per IP (stricter)
- **Voting endpoints**: 20 requests per minute per IP
- **Admin endpoints**: 200 requests per minute per IP
- **Automatic IP blocking** after repeated violations

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- SQL injection prevention (though we use JSON files)
- Payload size limits (1MB max)
- Content type validation
- Malicious script tag removal

### 3. Security Headers
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) in production

### 4. Authentication & Authorization
- OAuth integration (GitHub, Google)
- Session-based authentication
- Role-based access control (User, Organizer, SuperAdmin)
- Event-specific permissions
- Multi-level authorization checks

### 5. Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time API endpoint monitoring
- User activity tracking
- Security incident logging
- Performance metrics collection
- Automated suspicious activity detection

### 6. Data Protection
- Environment variable protection for secrets
- Secure session management
- Input sanitization
- File system access controls

## Admin Security Features

### Super Admin Dashboard
The super admin dashboard includes comprehensive monitoring tools:

1. **System Monitoring**
   - Server uptime and health
   - Memory and CPU usage
   - Active users and events
   - Performance metrics

2. **API Monitoring**
   - Request counts per endpoint
   - Response times
   - Error rates and types
   - Traffic patterns

3. **Security Monitoring**
   - Total and blocked requests
   - Suspicious activity alerts
   - IP address tracking
   - Rate limit violations

4. **User Activity Tracking**
   - Real-time user actions
   - Login/logout events
   - Administrative actions
   - Event participation

### Security Controls
- **IP Blocking**: Manual IP blocking with reason tracking
- **Rate Limit Configuration**: Adjustable rate limits per endpoint type
- **Activity Export**: Export monitoring data for analysis
- **Real-time Alerts**: Automatic flagging of suspicious behavior

## Attack Prevention

### 1. DDoS Protection
- Rate limiting per IP address
- Automatic blocking of aggressive IPs
- Request pattern analysis
- Resource usage monitoring

### 2. Injection Attacks
- Input sanitization for all user inputs
- Parameterized queries (when applicable)
- Content type validation
- Payload size restrictions

### 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- HTML entity encoding
- Script tag removal
- Content Security Policy headers
- Input validation

### 4. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
- SameSite cookie attributes
- Origin header validation
- Session token verification

### 5. Authentication Attacks
- Rate limiting on login endpoints
- Account lockout after failed attempts
- Strong session management
- OAuth token validation

## Deployment Security

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required environment variables
NODE_ENV=production
NUXT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret

# Security settings
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
MONITORING_ENABLED=true
```

### Production Recommendations
1. **Use HTTPS**: Always serve over SSL/TLS in production
2. **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies updated
3. **Security Audits**: Regular security scans and penetration testing
4. **Backup Strategy**: Regular automated backups
5. **Log Monitoring**: Centralized log aggregation and monitoring
6. **Firewall Configuration**: Restrict unnecessary ports and services

### Server Hardening
1. **Disable unnecessary services**
2. **Configure fail2ban for SSH protection**
3. **Set up automatic security updates**
4. **Use a reverse proxy (nginx/Apache) with security configurations**
5. **Implement network segmentation**

## Monitoring Setup

### Automated Alerts
Set up alerts for:
- High error rates (>5%)
- Unusual traffic patterns
- Multiple failed authentication attempts
- System resource exhaustion
- Security violations

### Log Analysis
Monitor logs for:
- Failed login attempts
- Administrative actions
- Error patterns
- Performance issues
- Security incidents

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Procedure
1. **Immediate Response**
   - Block malicious IPs
   - Disable compromised accounts
   - Isolate affected systems

2. **Investigation**
   - Export monitoring data
   - Analyze attack patterns
   - Identify vulnerabilities

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply security patches
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security measures

4. **Prevention**
   - Implement additional controls
   - Update monitoring rules
   - Document lessons learned
