## üìù **NOTES**

**What's Working Well:**
- Comprehensive database schema is in place
- All major UI components have been created
- Basic page structure for connections exists
- Component architecture follows Vue/Nuxt best practices

**Major Gaps:**
- APIs return mock data instead of real database queries
- No real-time connection tracking during events  
- Achievement system is purely visual
- No integration with external platforms
- Missing social sharing functionality

**Development Environment:**
- Nuxt.js application running on localhost:3000
- SQLite database with Prisma ORM
- Vue.js components with Vuetify UI framework
- All Phase 1 dependencies appear to be installed

**Next Steps:**
1. Start with fixing the API implementations
2. Test connection tracking during a real event
3. Implement achievement trigger logic
4. Add social sharing capabilities

*This TODO list will be updated as implementation progresses.*
