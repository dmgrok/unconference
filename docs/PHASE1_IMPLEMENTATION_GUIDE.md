# PHASE 1 IMPLEMENTATION: Work Sharing & People Connections

## 🎯 **FOCUS: Make Events Create Lasting Value**

**Core Problem:** People attend great events but lose connections and collaborative opportunities afterward.

**Phase 1 Solution:** Capture connections, enable work sharing, and facilitate follow-up collaborations.

---

## 🚀 **WEEK 1-2: IMMEDIATE IMPLEMENTATION**

### **Day 1-3: Database Setup**
```bash
# Run the Phase 1 migration
npm run db:migrate

# The migration adds:
# - User skills, interests, and contact preferences
# - Event connections tracking
# - Collaboration spaces
# - Resource sharing
# - Action items
# - Work showcases
# - Introduction requests
# - Achievement system
```

### **Day 4-7: Basic Connection Tracking**

**Add to existing event pages:**

1. **During Voting/Room Assignment**
   - Track who voted for same topics → potential connections
   - Track who gets assigned to same rooms → collaboration opportunities

2. **Room Discussion Pages**
   - Add "People in this discussion" sidebar
   - Enable contact exchange (opt-in)
   - Track collaboration formation

3. **Post-Event Summary**
   - Show "Your Connections" with contact info (if shared)
   - Display "Collaborations Started" 
   - Provide follow-up action prompts

### **Implementation Steps:**

```typescript
// 1. Add to user profile setup
interface UserConnectionProfile {
  skills: string[]        // "React", "Product Management", "Design"
  interests: string[]     // "AI", "Sustainability", "Remote Work"
  lookingFor: string[]   // "Co-founder", "Mentor", "Collaborators"
  allowContactSharing: boolean
  linkedinUrl?: string
}

// 2. Track interactions during event
function trackEventInteraction(eventId: string, userA: string, userB: string, context: string) {
  // Called when users:
  // - Vote for same topics
  // - Join same discussion rooms  
  // - Exchange contact info
  // - Start collaboration
}

// 3. Post-event connection summary
function generateConnectionSummary(userId: string, eventId: string) {
  return {
    connectionsEarned: number,
    collaborationsStarted: number,
    skillsShared: string[],
    skillsLearned: string[],
    suggestedFollowUps: Connection[]
  }
}
```

## 🔗 **WEEK 3-4: WORK COLLABORATION FEATURES**

### **Collaborative Workspaces**

**For each discussion topic:**
- **Shared Notes**: Collaborative Google Docs-style notes
- **Resource Hub**: Links, documents, tools mentioned
- **Action Items**: Who's doing what after the event
- **Contact Directory**: Participants who opt-in to sharing contact info

**Implementation:**
```vue
<!-- Add to discussion room pages -->
<CollaborationWorkspace
  :topic-id="topicId"
  :event-id="eventId"
  :participants="roomParticipants"
/>
```

### **Work Showcase Platform**

**Post-event project gallery:**
- Projects started at the event
- Skills needed vs. skills available
- Collaboration opportunities
- Success stories

```typescript
interface WorkShowcase {
  projectName: string
  description: string
  contributors: Person[]
  skillsNeeded: string[]
  status: 'ideation' | 'seeking-team' | 'active' | 'completed'
  contactInfo: string
}
```

## 📱 **WEEK 5-6: VIRAL SOCIAL FEATURES**

### **Achievement System**
```typescript
const achievements = [
  {
    id: 'super-connector',
    name: 'Super Connector', 
    description: 'Connected with 10+ people at an event',
    icon: 'mdi-account-group',
    shareText: 'Just earned Super Connector at #TechConf2025! 🤝'
  },
  {

    description: 'Started 3+ collaborations',
    icon: 'mdi-handshake',
    shareText: 'Started 3 new collaborations at today\'s event! 🚀'
  }
]
```

### **Shareable Content Generation**
```typescript
// Auto-generate social media content
const socialContent = {
  eventSummary: `Just attended an amazing unconference! 
    • Met ${connectionCount} incredible people
    • Started ${collaborationCount} new projects  
    • Learned about ${topicCount} fascinating topics

    Connected with experts in ${skills.join(', ')}
    
    Thanks @UnconferencePlatform for the smart introductions! 🤖`,
    
  workShowcase: `Excited to announce our new project "${projectName}"! 
    Started at today's unconference with an amazing team.
    
    ${description}
    
    Looking for: ${skillsNeeded.join(', ')}
    Get in touch! 📧`
}
```

## 🎯 **WEEK 7-8: INTEGRATION & VIRALITY**

### **External Platform Integration**

**Slack Integration:**
```typescript
// Create Slack channel for continued collaboration
async function createSlackChannel(collaboration: Collaboration) {
  return {
    channelName: `${collaboration.name.toLowerCase().replace(/\s+/g, '-')}`,
    members: collaboration.contributors.map(p => p.slackId),
    topic: collaboration.description,
    initialMessage: `Continuing our discussion from ${eventName}! 🎉`
  }
}
```

**LinkedIn Integration:**
```typescript
// Generate LinkedIn connection messages
function generateLinkedInMessage(connection: Connection) {
  return `Hi ${connection.person.name}! Great meeting you at ${eventName}. 
    I'd love to continue our conversation about ${connection.sharedTopics[0]}.`
}
```

### **Embeddable Widgets**
```html
<!-- For personal websites/portfolios -->
<script src="https://unconference.app/widgets.js"></script>

<!-- Show user's event connections -->
<div data-unconference-connections="{userId}"></div>

<!-- Display work showcase -->
<div data-unconference-projects="{userId}"></div>

<!-- Event network visualization -->
<div data-unconference-network="{eventId}"></div>
```
