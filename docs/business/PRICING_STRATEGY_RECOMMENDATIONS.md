## Executive Summary

Based on comprehensive business user feedback and market analysis, **we recommend pivoting from the current subscription-heavy model to a hybrid approach** that better aligns with actual customer usage patterns and budget approval processes.

### **Recommended Primary Strategy: Hybrid Project + Subscription Model**

**Core Recommendation:**
- **Per-Event Pricing:** $199-299 per event (directly competes with Sessionize's €500)
- **Subscription Option:** $79/month for unlimited events (for frequent users)
- **Enterprise Tier:** Custom pricing starting at $299/month
- **Free Trial:** 1 event (not monthly recurring)

**Expected Outcome:** 40% higher revenue per customer, easier budget approval, better market positioning as premium solution.

## Market Intelligence Summary

### **Critical Insights from Business User Analysis**

#### **Usage Pattern Reality Check**
| Assumption | Reality | Impact |
|------------|---------|---------|
| Monthly events per user | Quarterly events (3-4/year) | 75% overestimation of usage |
| $49/month acceptable | "Awkward approval zone" | Budget friction for recurring costs |
| Viral monthly free tier | "Solving problem that doesn't exist" | Resource waste on non-viable freemium |

#### **Competitive Intelligence: Sessionize Analysis**
- **Price Point:** €500 ($540) per event
- **Market Position:** Premium, established player
- **Customer Willingness:** Proven enterprise buyers at this price level
- **Opportunity:** 45-55% cost savings with superior OST-native features

#### **Budget Approval Process Reality**
| Price Range | Approval Process | Decision Timeline | Success Probability |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| <$25/month | Personal expense | 1-2 days | 85% |
| $25-100/month | Manager approval | 1-2 weeks | 60% |
| $100-300/month | Budget justification | 3-4 weeks | 40% |
| $300+/month | Formal procurement | 6-12 weeks | 25% |
| Project-based | Event budget | 1 week | 70% |
