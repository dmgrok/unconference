# Improved User Flow - Event Selection and Context

## Overview
This document describes the improved user experience for event selection and context management in the Unconference application.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Event Context Header
- **Feature**: Prominent display of currently selected event in the application header
- **Location**: Header shows event name with "Change" button
- **Benefit**: Users always know which event they're managing

### 2. Enhanced Event Selection
- **Feature**: Clearer call-to-action on events listing page
- **Changes**: 
  - Updated page subtitle to "Select an event to manage or participate in"
  - Changed button text from "Manage Event" to "Enter Event"
  - Made event cards more obviously clickable
- **Benefit**: Users understand they need to select an event first

### 3. Event Selection Confirmation
- **Feature**: Success message when event is selected
- **Location**: Shows on event detail page when `?selected=true` parameter is present
- **Benefit**: Users receive clear feedback that event context is established

### 4. No Event Selected States
- **Feature**: Helpful empty states on dashboard and voting pages
- **Behavior**: When no event is selected, shows informative message with action button
- **Benefit**: Users are guided to select an event instead of seeing empty/broken pages

### 5. Breadcrumb Navigation
- **Feature**: Clear navigation hierarchy on event detail pages
- **Format**: My Events > [Event Name]
- **Benefit**: Users understand their location and can easily navigate back

### 6. Context-Aware URLs
- **Feature**: Event-specific pages include eventId parameter
- **Examples**: 
  - `/dashboard?eventId=123`
  - `/voting?eventId=123`
- **Benefit**: Direct linking and better URL organization

## User Flow

### Before (Problems)
1. Login → Events list (unclear what to do)
2. User might directly go to /dashboard (no context)
3. Broken experience with no clear guidance

### After (Improved)
1. Login → Events list with clear "Select an event" messaging
2. User clicks "Enter Event" → Event detail page with confirmation
3. Event context shown in header throughout the app
4. All subsequent navigation maintains event context
5. Clear guidance when no event is selected

## Technical Implementation

### Files Modified
- `layouts/default.vue` - Added event context header
- `pages/events/index.vue` - Enhanced event selection UX
- `pages/events/[eventId].vue` - Added breadcrumbs and confirmation
- `pages/dashboard.vue` - Added no-event state
- `pages/voting.vue` - Added no-event state
- `pages/login.vue` - Improved redirect logic

### Key Components
- Event context chip in header
- No-event state cards
- Enhanced event selection buttons
- Breadcrumb navigation
- Success confirmations

## Future Enhancements
- Event switcher dropdown in header
- Recently accessed events quick list
- Persistent event context across sessions
- Event-specific URL structure (`/events/{id}/dashboard`)
