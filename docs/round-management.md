3. Admins can manually select up to the configured maximum
4. Participants from unselected topics are redistributed

## Best Practices

### For Event Organizers

4. **Room Coordination**: Ensure room assignments match selected topics

### For Participants

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **No Topic Assignment**: Participant didn't vote or their topics weren't selected
- **Timer Not Updating**: Refresh page or check internet connection
- **Round Won't Start**: Ensure at least one topic is selected
- **Missing Round History**: Check file permissions for `data/round-history.json`

### Admin Controls
- Use "End Round" to stop timer early if needed
- "Quick New Round" bypasses topic selection for traditional workflow
- Settings page allows adjustment of default round parameters
