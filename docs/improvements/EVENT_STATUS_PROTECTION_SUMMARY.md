# Event Status Protection - Implementation Summary

## Problem
Users were able to start rounds, vote, and perform other actions even when events were inactive (closed or suspended). This violated the business logic that inactive events should be read-only.

## Solution
Implemented comprehensive event status checks across both backend APIs and frontend UI to prevent actions when events are inactive.

## Files Modified

### Backend (7 files)

1. **`server/utils/eventStatusHelper.ts`** (NEW)
   - Created utility functions for checking event status
   - `checkEventStatus(eventId)` - Returns status information
   - `requireActiveEvent(eventId)` - Throws error if event inactive

2. **`server/api/events/[eventId]/rounds/start.post.ts`**
   - Added import for `requireActiveEvent`
   - Added status check before allowing round creation

3. **`server/api/events/[eventId]/topics/index.post.ts`**
   - Added import for `requireActiveEvent`
   - Added status check before allowing topic creation

4. **`server/api/admin/start-round.post.ts`**
   - Added import for `requireActiveEvent`
   - Added status check for event-specific round starting

5. **`server/api/topics/new-round.post.ts`**
   - Added comment noting this is legacy endpoint
   - Kept working for single-event backward compatibility

6. **`server/api/topics/[id]/edit.post.ts`**
   - Added comment noting this is legacy endpoint

7. **`server/api/topics/[id]/delete.post.ts`**
   - Added comment noting this is legacy endpoint

### Frontend (3 files)

1. **`pages/voting.vue`**
   - Added `canEditEvent` check to `voteForTopic()` function
   - Added `canEditEvent` check to `resetVotes()` function
   - Shows alerts when trying to vote on inactive events

2. **`pages/admin/round-management.vue`**
   - Added `useEventStatus()` composable
   - Updated `canStartRound` computed to include event status
   - Added warning alert for inactive events

3. **`pages/organizer.vue`**
   - Added `useEventStatus()` composable  
   - Added warning alert for inactive events

### Documentation (2 files)

1. **`docs/improvements/EVENT_STATUS_PROTECTION.md`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive documentation of the implementation
   - Lists all changes and rationale

2. **`test-event-status-protection.sh`** (NEW)
   - Test script to verify the protection works
   - Tests both API endpoints and provides UI testing guidance

## Key Features

### Backend Protection
- **HTTP 403 errors** when attempting actions on inactive events
- **Clear error messages** explaining why action was blocked
- **Event-specific validation** using event ID from URLs
- **Backward compatibility** for legacy single-event endpoints

### Frontend Protection  
- **Disabled action buttons** when events are inactive
- **Warning alerts** displayed prominently on admin pages
- **User-friendly messages** explaining why actions are unavailable
- **Graceful degradation** to read-only mode

### Event Status Sources
Events can be inactive due to:
- Closed by organizer (`closedAt` timestamp)
- Suspended by administrator (`suspendedAt` timestamp)  
- Explicitly set inactive (`isActive: false`)

## Testing
Run the test script: `./test-event-status-protection.sh`

The script will guide you through:
1. Verifying normal operation when event is active
2. Closing/suspending the event
3. Testing that actions are properly blocked
4. Verifying UI protection works correctly

## Impact
- ✅ **Security**: Prevents unauthorized actions on inactive events
- ✅ **User Experience**: Clear feedback when actions are unavailable  
- ✅ **Data Integrity**: Maintains event state consistency
- ✅ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy endpoints still work for single-event mode
- ✅ **Administrative Control**: Organizers/admins can still view and manage event status
