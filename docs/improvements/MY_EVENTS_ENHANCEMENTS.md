# My Events Page Enhancements

## Overview

Enhanced the "My Events" page to better support organizers managing inactive events and to clearly display user roles.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Role Display Enhancement
**Problem**: User roles were not clearly visible on event cards, and role information wasn't being loaded properly.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced API endpoint `/api/events/my-events.get.ts` to include user role information
- Added prominent role chips with icons for each event card
- Organizer events now have a blue border to make them stand out
- Added role-specific icons:
  - 👑 Crown for Organizers
  - 🛡️ Shield for Moderators  
  - 👤 Person for Participants
  - ❓ Question mark for Guests

### 2. Inactive Event Access for Organizers
**Problem**: Organizers couldn't access their inactive events, making it impossible to reactivate them.

**Solution**:
- Organizers can now access event settings even when events are inactive
- Primary button for organizers changes based on event status:
  - Active events: "Manage Event" → goes to organizer dashboard
  - Inactive events: "View Settings" → goes to settings page
- Added secondary "Join Voting" button for active events
- Clear visual indicators when events are inactive but accessible

### 3. Improved Event Status Controls
**Enhanced Features**:
- Reactivate button now says "Reactivate" instead of "Start" for clarity
- Better button styling and layout
- Added information alert for inactive events that organizers can access
- Status chips now include icons (checkmark for active, pause for inactive)

### 4. Visual Enhancements
**Card Layout**:
- Role information prominently displayed with icons
- Organizer events have distinctive blue border
- Status chips repositioned for better visual hierarchy
- Inactive events show helpful information alerts for organizers

## User Experience Improvements

### For Organizers
- ✅ Can always access their events, even when inactive

- ✅ Easy reactivation with prominent button
- ✅ Direct access to event settings for management

### For Participants/Members

### For All Users

## Technical Changes

### API Enhancement
```typescript
// Enhanced my-events API to include role information
const eventsWithRoles = await Promise.all(
  userEvents.map(async (evt) => {
    const userRole = await eventService.getUserRoleInEvent(userId, evt.id)
    return {
      ...evt,
      role: userRole,
      joinedAt: evt.createdAt
    }
  })
)
```

### UI Component Updates
```vue
<!-- Role-based button logic -->
<v-btn 
  v-if="event.role === 'Organizer'"
  :to="`/settings?eventId=${event.id}`"
  color="primary"
>
  {{ event.isActive ? 'Manage Event' : 'View Settings' }}
</v-btn>

<!-- Enhanced role display -->
<v-chip :color="getRoleColor(event.role)" variant="flat">
  <v-icon start>{{ getRoleIcon(event.role) }}</v-icon>
  {{ event.role || 'Participant' }}
</v-chip>
```

## Files Modified

## Benefits

1. **Organizer Empowerment**: Organizers can now properly manage their events regardless of status
2. **Clear Role Hierarchy**: Users immediately understand their role in each event
3. **Better Visual Design**: More intuitive and accessible interface
4. **Reduced Confusion**: Clear indicators of what actions are available based on role and event status
5. **Improved Workflow**: Seamless transition between viewing and managing events

This enhancement addresses the core user experience issues while maintaining the security model of the platform.
