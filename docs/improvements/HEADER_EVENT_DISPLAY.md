## Technical Implementation

### Header Component Updates
```vue
<!-- Current event display with selector -->
<div v-if="showCurrentEvent && currentEvent" class="ml-6 d-flex align-center">
  <v-divider vertical class="mx-3" />
  <div class="event-info">
    <div class="d-flex align-center">
      <v-chip :color="currentEvent.isActive ? 'success' : 'warning'">
        {{ currentEvent.isActive ? 'Active' : 'Inactive' }}
      </v-chip>
      <div>
        <div class="text-body-2 font-weight-medium">{{ currentEvent.name }}</div>
        <div class="text-caption">{{ currentEvent.code }}</div>
      </div>
      <!-- Event selector menu for multiple events -->
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
```

### Event Context Management
- Uses existing `useCurrentEvent` composable for event data
- Leverages `useEventContext` for event ID management
- Integrates with existing `/api/auth/set-current-event` endpoint
- Maintains session state across page navigation

### Responsive Design
- Event info hidden on mobile screens (`display: none` at mobile breakpoint)
- Header remains clean and functional on smaller devices
- Event selector adapts to touch interfaces

## User Experience Flow

### For Users with Single Event:
1. User selects event from events list ‚Üí navigates to event detail page
2. Event context is set and header shows current event information
3. User navigates to event management pages (voting, dashboard, etc.)
4. Header consistently shows the selected event across all pages

### For Users with Multiple Events:
1. User selects event from events list ‚Üí navigates to event detail page
2. Header shows current event with dropdown selector
3. User can switch events directly from header without returning to events list
4. Event context updates immediately when switching events
5. All event management pages reflect the newly selected event

### Navigation Pattern:
1. **Events List** `/events` - Browse available events
2. **Event Detail** `/events/[eventId]` - Event overview and quick actions
3. **Event Management** `/voting`, `/dashboard`, etc. - Specific event functions
4. **Header Context** - Always shows current event for context

## Benefits

- **Clear Context**: Users always know which event they're managing
- **Quick Switching**: No need to return to events list for multi-event users
- **Consistent UX**: Event information visible across all event detail screens
- **Better Navigation**: Logical flow from event browsing to event management
- **Mobile Friendly**: Responsive design maintains usability on all devices
