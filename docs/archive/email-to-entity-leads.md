# Email to Entity Leads - Talk Confirmation and Participant Lists

**Subject:** Urgent: Talk Confirmation and Participant List Required

---

Dear Entity Leads,

I hope this message finds you well.

As we finalize the arrangements for our upcoming unconference, I need your immediate assistance with two critical items:

## 1. Talk Confirmation (URGENT - Need ASAP)
You should have received the list of people who have been accepted to present talks within your entity. Please review this list and **confirm immediately**:
- Which talks are definitively accepted and will proceed as planned
- Any talks that need to be declined or modified

**This confirmation is needed as soon as possible** as it directly impacts our scheduling and capacity planning.

## 2. Participant Lists (Deadline: End of Month)
For all confirmed talks, please provide the complete list of participants who will be attending each session. This information will help us:
- Determine how many additional slots we can accommodate
- Plan room capacity and logistics
- Finalize our overall event capacity

**Please send participant lists by the end of this month.**

## Next Steps
Once we receive both confirmations and participant numbers, we'll be able to:
- Calculate available extra slots
- Communicate final schedules
- Complete venue and catering arrangements

## Action Required
Please reply to this email with:
1. âœ… **Immediate**: Confirmation of which talks are proceeding
2. ðŸ“‹ **By month-end**: Complete participant lists for confirmed talks

If you have any questions or need clarification on any of the accepted talks, please don't hesitate to reach out immediately.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. Your quick response is essential for the success of our unconference.

Best regards,

[Your Name]  
Conference Organizer  
[Your Contact Information]
