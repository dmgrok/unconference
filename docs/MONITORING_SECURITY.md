## üõ°Ô∏è Security Features

### 1. Rate Limiting
Protects against abuse and DDoS attacks:
- **General endpoints**: 100 requests/minute per IP
- **Authentication endpoints**: 10 requests/minute per IP
- **Voting endpoints**: 20 requests/minute per IP
- **Admin endpoints**: 200 requests/minute per IP

### 2. Input Validation & Sanitization
- XSS prevention through input cleaning
- Malicious script removal
- Payload size limits (1MB max)
- Content type validation

### 3. Security Headers
Automatically applied to all responses:
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`
- `Permissions-Policy: camera=(), microphone=(), geolocation=()`
- `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS in production)

### 4. CSRF Protection
- Token-based CSRF protection
- Automatic token generation and validation
- Client-side integration for secure requests

### 5. IP Blocking
Super admins can manually block malicious IP addresses:
1. Click "Block IP" in the monitoring dashboard
2. Enter the IP address and reason
3. The IP will be immediately blocked from all requests

### 6. Suspicious Activity Detection
Automatic detection and flagging of:
- Rate limit violations
- Large payload attacks
- Invalid request patterns
- Multiple authentication failures

## üìä Health Monitoring

### Health Check Endpoint
- **URL**: `/api/health`
- **Method**: GET
- **Purpose**: Monitor application health
- **Returns**: System status, uptime, memory usage, and service checks

### Response Example
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "timestamp": "2025-01-01T12:00:00.000Z",
  "uptime": 3600,
  "memory": { "heapUsed": 50000000, "heapTotal": 100000000 },
  "checks": {
    "filesystem": true,
    "dataAccess": true,
    "auth": true
  },
  "responseTime": 15
}
```

## üö® Security Alerts

### Automatic Blocking
The system automatically blocks IPs after:
- 5+ suspicious activities
- Repeated rate limit violations
- Malicious payload attempts

### Manual Intervention
Super admins can:
- View suspicious IP addresses
- Manually block/unblock IPs
- Review security incident logs
- Export security data for analysis

## üìà Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics Tracked
- **Response Times**: Average and per-endpoint response times
- **Error Rates**: Success vs. error request ratios
- **Traffic Patterns**: Request volume and distribution
- **Resource Usage**: Memory, CPU, and disk utilization

### Performance Insights
- Slow endpoint identification (>1000ms response time)
- High-traffic endpoint analysis
- Error pattern detection
- Resource bottleneck identification

## üîí Best Practices Implemented

### 1. Secure Defaults
- HTTPS enforcement in production
- Secure cookie settings
- Strong password requirements
- Session timeout management

### 2. Defense in Depth
- Multiple security layers
- Input validation at all levels
- Output encoding and sanitization
- Error handling without information disclosure

### 3. Monitoring & Alerting
- Real-time threat detection
- Comprehensive audit logging
- Performance monitoring
- Automated incident response

### 4. Data Protection
- Environment variable secrets
- Secure file permissions
- Access control enforcement
- Regular backup procedures

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Security settings
NODE_ENV=production
RATE_LIMIT_ENABLED=true
SECURITY_HEADERS_ENABLED=true
MONITORING_ENABLED=true

# Secrets (set these securely)
NUXT_SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=your-github-secret
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-secret
```

### Security Middleware
The following middleware are automatically applied:
1. **Security middleware**: Rate limiting, input validation, security headers
2. **Monitoring middleware**: Request tracking and user activity logging
3. **CSRF middleware**: Cross-site request forgery protection

## üìã Maintenance Tasks

### Daily
- Review security logs in the monitoring dashboard
- Check for any blocked IPs or suspicious activity
- Monitor system performance metrics

### Weekly
- Export and analyze monitoring data
- Review user activity patterns
- Update dependency security patches

### Monthly
- Conduct security audit using `npm audit`
- Review and update rate limiting rules
- Analyze performance trends and optimize

### Quarterly
- Perform penetration testing
- Review and update security policies
- Audit user permissions and access levels

## üöÄ Deployment Security

Use the provided secure deployment script:
```bash
./scripts/secure-deploy.sh
```

This script will:
- Validate environment configuration
- Set up secure file permissions
- Run security audits
- Configure monitoring
- Set up firewall rules
- Create systemd service files
- Perform health checks

## üìû Security Incident Response

If you detect suspicious activity:

1. **Immediate Response**
   - Block the malicious IP via the dashboard
   - Review recent user activities
   - Check for any data modifications

2. **Investigation**
   - Export monitoring data for analysis
   - Review system logs
   - Identify attack patterns

3. **Recovery**
   - Apply additional security measures
   - Update rate limiting rules
   - Notify affected users if necessary

4. **Prevention**
   - Update security configurations
   - Implement additional monitoring
   - Document lessons learned
